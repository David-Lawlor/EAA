Week 1 Lab: Using Linux Fedora
Tutorial 1.

In this first tutorial we want to increase the number of CPUs which are allocated to our Fedora VM:

1. Start VirtualBox and go to the settings of your VM
2. Under System, choose the processor tab
3. Increase the number of processors to 2
4. Now boot the VM

--its not immediately clear how many processors the VM now has (top doesn't show this clearly). Lets take a look.

1. Open a X terminal session - we are going to issue some linux commands to find out how many cores we now have.
2. The file of interest to us is the /proc/cpuinfo file. How do we view this file?
3. Use the man page examine the more command
4. Now use the more command to examine the contents of /proc/cpuinfo
5. This file may still be hard to read. We are really interested in seeing how many "processor" strings appear in the file (ie, one per core)
6. So we search the file: The string search routing in Linux is grep. Check the man page for this. 
7. We need to send the results of the grep command to be "counted" by another command. This counting command is called wc. Check the man page for this command.
8. Now, we need to combine the command from 6. and 7. using the unix pipe command: http://www.december.com/unix/tutor/pipesfilters.html
9. Does this output look correct? If not, check the man page for wc (and look for a way to get wc to count the number of lines it read)


more /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l
